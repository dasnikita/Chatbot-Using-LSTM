# Chatbot-Using-LSTM
In this project, I have implemented a retrieval-based chatbot for a Ticketing Portal using tensorflow and LSTM. I have created a dataset using a JSON file and converted it into a dataframe to train our model. I have then preprocessed the data by lowering the case and eliminating punctuations. Further, created a model using an LSTM architecture. This model gave us an accuracy of 96%. Tested thr model by running ‘Ticketbot’ and predicted responses of it.
