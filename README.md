# Chatbot-Using-LSTM
In this project, we have implemented a retrieval-based chatbot for a Ticketing Portal using tensorflow and LSTM. We have discussed the inner workings of a chatbot and how the technologies used in this project are a benefit to it. We have created a dataset using a JSON file and converted it into a dataframe to train our model. We have then preprocessed our data by lowering the case and eliminating punctuations. Further, we have discussed RNNs and LSTMs and created a model using an LSTM architecture. This model gave us an accuracy of 96%. Later we tested our model by running our ‘Ticketbot’ and predicted responses of it.
